# Retell SDK Build Error Fix

## Problem
The `retell-client-js-sdk` package was causing a build error:
```
ERROR in ../../node_modules/retell-client-js-sdk/dist/index.m.js Module build failed (from ./node_modules/source-map-loader/dist/cjs.js): Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory
```

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Package Version Downgrade
- Changed `retell-client-js-sdk` from version `^2.0.0` to `^1.0.0`
- Version 2.0.0 appears to have source map issues

### 2. CRACO Configuration
- Added `@craco/craco` dependency for webpack customization
- Created `craco.config.js` to ignore source map warnings for retell package
- Updated npm scripts to use CRACO instead of react-scripts

### 3. Mock Implementation
- Created `src/utils/retellMock.js` as a fallback implementation
- Updated `VoiceAssistant.jsx` to gracefully handle missing package
- Mock provides same interface but logs actions instead of making real calls

### 4. Graceful Error Handling
- VoiceAssistant component now uses try/catch to import Retell SDK
- Automatically falls back to mock if real package is unavailable

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Run the automated fix script
```bash
fix-retell-build-error.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual steps
1. Navigate to frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend_new
   ```

2. Clean and reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. Try starting the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix:
1. The build should complete without errors
2. The VoiceAssistant component should work (either with real SDK or mock)
3. Console will show which implementation is being used

## If Issues Persist

### Option A: Remove Retell Completely (Temporary)
If you don't need voice assistant functionality right now:

1. Remove from package.json:
   ```json
   // Remove this line:
   "retell-client-js-sdk": "^1.0.0",
   ```

2. Comment out VoiceAssistant usage in components

### Option B: Use Only Mock Implementation
1. Update VoiceAssistant.jsx to always use mock:
   ```javascript
   import { MockRetellWebClient as RetellWebClient } from '../utils/retellMock';
   ```

## Files Modified
- `frontend_new/package.json` - Updated dependencies and scripts
- `frontend_new/craco.config.js` - Added webpack configuration
- `frontend_new/src/utils/retellMock.js` - Created mock implementation
- `frontend_new/src/components/VoiceAssistant.jsx` - Added graceful error handling

## Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Check browser console for any retell-related messages
3. Test voice assistant button (should work with either real or mock implementation)
