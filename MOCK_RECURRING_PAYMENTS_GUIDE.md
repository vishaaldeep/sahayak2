# Mock Recurring Payments System - Sahayak Platform

## üéØ **Overview**

This implementation creates a complete mock recurring payment system that simulates Decentro integration without making actual API calls. Employers can set up recurring payments for employees with various frequencies, and the system automatically processes payments and updates employee wallets.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

### **For Employers:**
- ‚úÖ **Setup Recurring Payments**: Configure automated payments for employees
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Frequencies**: Minutes, hours, daily, weekly, monthly
- ‚úÖ **Payment Management**: Pause, resume, cancel payments
- ‚úÖ **Manual Triggers**: Process payments immediately for testing
- ‚úÖ **Payment History**: Track all payment transactions
- ‚úÖ **Mock Decentro Integration**: Simulates real payment flow without API calls

### **For Employees:**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Wallet Updates**: Receive payments directly in wallet
- ‚úÖ **Transaction History**: View all payment transactions with details
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Balance**: Updated wallet balance after each payment
- ‚úÖ **Payment Metadata**: Complete transaction details including employer info

### **System Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Automated Processing**: Scheduler runs every minute to process due payments
- ‚úÖ **Database Persistence**: All payments and transactions stored in MongoDB
- ‚úÖ **Status Management**: Active, paused, cancelled, completed states
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of payment failures
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Complete payment history with transaction IDs

5. Choose frequency (minutes for testing, daily/weekly/monthly for production)
6. Set interval value (e.g., every 2 days, every 3 hours)
7. Add description
8. Click "Create Recurring Payment"

#### **2. Manage Payments:**
- **View All Payments**: Dashboard shows all recurring payments with status
- **Pause Payment**: Temporarily stop payments
- **Resume Payment**: Restart paused payments
- **Cancel Payment**: Permanently stop payments
- **Manual Trigger**: Process payment immediately for testing
- **View History**: See all payment transactions

#### **3. Payment Frequencies:**
- **Minutes**: For testing - payments every few minutes
- **Hours**: Hourly payments (e.g., every 2 hours)
- **Daily**: Daily payments (e.g., every day, every 3 days)
- **Weekly**: Weekly payments (e.g., every week, every 2 weeks)
- **Monthly**: Monthly payments (e.g., every month, every 3 months)

### **For Employees:**

#### **1. View Wallet:**
- Check current wallet balance
- View all transaction history
- Filter transactions by type (all, recurring, credits, debits)

#### **2. Transaction Details:**
- Payment amount and date
- Employer information
- Payment frequency and method
- Transaction and flow IDs
- Payment status

## üß™ **Testing Guide**

### **1. Quick Test Setup:**
```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend_new
npm run dev

# Run test script
npm run test-mock-payments
```

### **2. Manual Testing:**

#### **Step 1: Create Test Payment**
1. Login as employer
2. Go to recurring payments dashboard
3. Create payment with "minutes" frequency
4. Set interval to 1 (every 1 minute)
5. Select test employee

#### **Step 2: Verify Creation**
- Check success message with Flow ID
- Verify payment appears in dashboard
- Note next payment date

#### **Step 3: Wait for Automatic Processing**
- Scheduler runs every minute
- Check server logs for processing messages
- Verify employee wallet receives payment

#### **Step 4: Manual Testing**
- Use "Pay Now" button for immediate testing
- Check transaction appears in employee wallet
- Verify wallet balance increases

### **3. Test Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 1: Multiple Frequencies**
- Create payments with different frequencies
- Verify each processes at correct intervals
- Check payment history accuracy

#### **Scenario 2: Status Management**
- Pause active payment
- Verify no payments processed while paused
- Resume and verify payments restart

#### **Scenario 3: Employee Wallet**
- Login as employee
- Check wallet shows all payments received
- Verify transaction metadata is complete

## üìä **Monitoring & Debugging**

### **Server Logs:**
```bash
# Payment processing logs
üîÑ Processing due recurring payments...
Found 2 due payments
‚úÖ Processed payment: PAY_ABC123 for 1000
üí∞ Wallet transaction created: TXN_XYZ789

# Scheduler logs
üí∞ Processed 2 recurring payments at 2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z
üöÄ Mock recurring payment scheduler started (runs every minute)
```

### **Database Verification:**
```javascript
// Check recurring payments
db.recurringpayments.find({status: 'active'})

// Check wallet transactions
db.wallettransactions.find({type: 'credit'}).sort({created_at: -1})

// Check wallet balances
db.wallets.find({})
```

### **API Testing:**
```bash
# Test payment creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mock-recurring-payments/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employee_id":"USER_ID","amount":1000,"frequency":"minutes","description":"Test payment"}'

# Test manual trigger
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mock-recurring-payments/PAYMENT_ID/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## üîß **Configuration Options**

### **Payment Frequencies:**
```javascript
const frequencyOptions = [
  { value: 'minutes', label: 'Minutes', description: 'For testing - payments every few minutes' },
  { value: 'hours', label: 'Hours', description: 'Hourly payments' },
  { value: 'daily', label: 'Daily', description: 'Daily payments' },
  { value: 'weekly', label: 'Weekly', description: 'Weekly payments' },
  { value: 'monthly', label: 'Monthly', description: 'Monthly payments' }
];
```

### **Scheduler Configuration:**
```javascript
// Current: Runs every minute
// To change frequency, modify cron pattern in mockRecurringPaymentScheduler.js
cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => { // Every minute
cron.schedule('*/5 * * * *', async () => { // Every 5 minutes
cron.schedule('0 * * * *', async () => { // Every hour
```

### **Mock Decentro Response:**
```javascript
// Simulated successful response
{
  flow_id: 'MOCK_FLOW_ABC123',
  status: 'SUCCESS',
  message: 'Payment flow created successfully',
  next_payment_date: '2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z'
}
```

## üéØ **Production Considerations**

### **1. Real Decentro Integration:**
When ready for production, replace mock calls with real Decentro API:
```javascript
// Replace in mockRecurringPaymentController.js
const decentroResponse = await decentroAPI.createRecurringPayment({
  amount: recurringPayment.amount,
  frequency: recurringPayment.frequency,
  // ... other parameters
});
```

### **2. Security Enhancements:**
- Add rate limiting for payment creation
- Implement payment amount limits
- Add additional authentication for sensitive operations
- Encrypt sensitive payment data

### **3. Performance Optimization:**
- Batch process multiple payments
- Implement payment queuing for high volume
- Add database indexing for payment queries
- Cache frequently accessed data

### **4. Error Handling:**
- Implement retry logic for failed payments
- Add notification system for payment failures
- Create admin dashboard for payment monitoring
- Implement payment reconciliation
